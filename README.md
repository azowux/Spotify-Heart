Song Like/Dislike Spotify Toggle Hotkey â€” Forget Frustrating Heart Clicking

Instruction:
  1. Download executable.
  2. Locate it to a comfortable directory to launch from (desktop).
  3. Launch Spotify if you haven't yet.
  3. Launch executable, you'll see a Spotify heart icon in tray. You might suspend the hotkey, pause the script or quit the app entirely from tray right click menu.
  4. Press F5 from anywhere to activate the Spotify window, automatically locate & click the heart icon (no matter where the heart actually is), reactivate the initial window.
  5. On first launch, the Spotify window will autoresize for compatible heart icon image search.

Many people were asking for it and here we finally go. Users kept questioning the Spotify Supp Team for reasons for a lack of such a common functionality: favorite hotkey. Up to a current moment the Team hasn't stated anything clear about it. Honestly I seriously doubt the real reasons are the trivial to state: users always think there's only one for the Product Server to serve: themselves. They don't mind millions of simultaneous connectins. It might lead to entire system break. Even though the tool is distributed openly, I'm declaring I'll remove the tool in case Spotify asks me (I'm not their employee).

Until the current moment, however, enjoy!
